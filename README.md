# The babynames frequency display app



This implements an R shiny front-end to Hadley
Wickham's
[babynames R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/babynames/index.html). 

The shiny page is [here](https://rmcd1024.shinyapps.io/babynames_shiny).

The data set is a based on Social Security data and reports every name with
more than 5 occurrences in a year.

If you're interested in the data, I highly recommend checking out [Hadley's
github site for the package](http://github.com/hadley/babynames).  The
`data-raw` directory contains the R programs that will download the original
data and recreate the data set.
